    front: 'What is the "so what?" test for every slide and point?',
    back: 'After stating any fact, statistic, or point, immediately answer the implied question "So what?" in your audience\'s mind. Don\'t say: "We grew 20% last year." Do say: "We grew 20% last year - that means we can now invest in the expansion you\'ve been requesting." Always connect information to audience impact. If you can\'t answer "so what?", the point doesn\'t belong in your presentation.',

    back: 'Like a lighthouse beacon, slowly sweep your gaze across the entire room while speaking, pausing briefly to make eye contact with individuals in different sections. Move systematically: far left, center left, center, center right, far right, then reverse. This ensures everyone feels included, prevents you from fixating on one friendly face, and projects confidence. In very large venues, pick individuals in each section as focal points.',

    back: 'When questions arise that are off-topic or require lengthy answers, use the parking lot: "Great question - that deserves more time than we have now. Let me put it in the parking lot and we can discuss it afterward/offline." Write it visibly on a flip chart. This validates the questioner, keeps the session on track, and shows you won\'t ignore difficult questions. Always follow up on parking lot items.',

    back: 'No more than 5 bullet points per slide, no more than 5 words per bullet. This forces ruthless editing and ensures slides support rather than replace your verbal message. Even better: aim for 1-2 bullets or eliminate text entirely in favor of visuals. If you need more content, create more slides. Audiences cannot read and listen simultaneously - when they read, they stop hearing you.',

    back: 'Place an empty chair in front of you while practicing and imagine your target audience member sitting there. Speak directly to that specific person. This helps you: Use appropriate language for that audience, anticipate their questions and objections, maintain conversational rather than lecturing tone, and add relevant examples for that person. A presentation for executives differs from one for frontline staff.',

    back: 'Engagement naturally dips every 10 minutes. Plan "energy lifts" at these intervals: Ask the audience a question, have them turn to a neighbor and discuss, do a quick poll or show of hands, share a surprising statistic, tell a story, show a short video, or change your position in the room. These pattern interrupts reset attention. Never let more than 10 minutes pass without an energy lift.',

Additional virtual rules: Look presentable from the waist up, check your background for inappropriate items, close unnecessary browser tabs (notification sounds), turn off phone, and test technology 15 minutes early. Technical failures destroy credibility.',

Having backup plans transforms anxiety into confidence. Knowing you can handle the worst makes the actual presentation feel easy. Also imagine yourself recovering gracefully from mistakes - mental rehearsal of resilience builds actual resilience.',

Technique: Acknowledge the question briefly, provide a direct answer, then bridge ("What\'s important to remember is...") to your key message. Politicians and executives use this constantly. You control your message; don\'t let random questions derail it.',

Strong endings: Circle back to your opening story with a new twist, issue a clear call-to-action, share a provocative final thought, use a powerful quote, or paint a vivid picture of the future. Write your closing word-for-word and memorize it. Then pause, say "Thank you," and stop talking. Resist the urge to keep going.',
