    back: 'Psychological detachment is mentally disengaging from work during non-work time - not thinking about tasks, problems, or responsibilities. Research shows it\'s essential for recovery, reducing fatigue, and preventing burnout. It requires deliberate practices like rituals, boundaries, and engaging alternative activities that absorb attention.',

    back: 'Chronic stress shrinks the hippocampus (memory and learning), reduces prefrontal cortex volume (executive function and regulation), and enlarges the amygdala (fear and reactivity). It also reduces neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity. These changes are partially reversible with stress reduction and recovery practices.',

I - Investigate with curiosity and kindness (where do you feel it?). N - Nurture with self-compassion (what do you need?). It transforms reactive stress into mindful response.',

    back: 'Moral injury occurs when someone perpetrates, fails to prevent, or witnesses acts that transgress deeply held moral beliefs. Unlike PTSD (fear-based), moral injury involves guilt, shame, and existential crisis. It\'s common in healthcare, military, and situations where systemic failures force compromising one\'s values, contributing to severe burnout.',

    back: 'The recovery paradox is that those who most need recovery (highly stressed, burned out) are least likely to engage in it. Stress impairs self-regulation, making healthy choices harder. Exhaustion reduces motivation for exercise, stress promotes poor sleep habits, and overwhelm crowds out recovery time. Breaking this cycle requires minimal-effort entry points.',
