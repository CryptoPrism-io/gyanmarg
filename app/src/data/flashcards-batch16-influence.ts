These principles work because they serve as mental shortcuts that usually lead to good decisions but can be exploited.',

    back: 'Reciprocity is the social rule that we should repay what another person has provided us. It\'s powerful because: 1) It\'s universal across cultures, 2) It can trigger unequal exchanges - a small favor can generate a much larger return, 3) It can create unwanted debts, 4) It works even with uninvited favors. The rule evolved to enable division of labor and create interdependencies that benefit society. To resist: recognize when favors are manipulation tactics and mentally redefine them as sales devices rather than gifts.',

    back: 'The Door-in-the-Face technique involves making a large request that will likely be refused, then following with a smaller, more reasonable request. It works through reciprocal concessions: when someone retreats from their initial position, we feel obligated to reciprocate by also making a concession (accepting the second request). Studies show this technique can increase compliance by 300-400%. It also increases follow-through because people feel more responsible for agreements they "negotiated." Counter it by recognizing the pattern and evaluating the second request on its own merits.',

This works because: 1) Consistency is valued by society as rational and stable, 2) It provides a mental shortcut - no need to re-analyze situations, 3) Written and public commitments are strongest, 4) Active commitments (effortful) are more binding than passive ones, 5) Internal commitments (chosen without external pressure) are most lasting.

The Romeo and Juliet effect: parental interference makes relationships more attractive.

Techniques include: strategic questions ("Do you consider yourself adventurous?"), environmental priming (images, music, words), and creating favorable mindsets. Pre-suasion works because the moment before a message is delivered is a privileged moment for influence - it opens a window of receptivity.',

They occur when attention is naturally focused on something related to the message. Types include: 1) Created moments - manufactured through pre-suasive techniques, 2) Natural moments - occurring through life circumstances (transitions, decisions, identity threats). Effective communicators identify and leverage these moments. Example: people are more receptive to insurance offers after hearing about a disaster.

    back: 'Stories persuade more effectively than data because: 1) Narrative transportation - we get absorbed and lower our defenses, 2) Emotional engagement - stories activate emotional processing, 3) Concrete imagery - vivid details are memorable and seem real, 4) Character identification - we simulate the protagonist\'s experience, 5) Implicit persuasion - lessons aren\'t explicitly "sold" to us. One vivid story often outweighs compelling statistics (identifiable victim effect). Effective influence: lead with a story, follow with data. Defense: when moved by a story, deliberately seek out base rate statistics. Ask: "Is this story representative or exceptional?"',

    back: 'Implementation intentions ("If/When X happens, then I will Y") dramatically increase follow-through by: 1) Creating automatic associations between situations and responses, 2) Reducing reliance on willpower in the moment, 3) Pre-deciding to remove decision fatigue, 4) Increasing attention to trigger situations. Research shows they double success rates for difficult behaviors. Format: "When [situation], I will [specific behavior]." Examples: "When I feel the urge to check social media during work, I will take three deep breaths and return to my task." Application in influence: help others form implementation intentions rather than just general commitments.',

    back: 'The Mere Exposure Effect: repeated exposure to something increases our liking for it, even without conscious recognition. This explains: 1) Why advertising works through repetition, 2) Why familiar candidates have electoral advantages, 3) Why songs "grow on us," 4) Why proximity increases attraction. The effect works best when: exposures are brief, spaced over time, and the initial reaction isn\'t strongly negative. It works even subliminally. Application: increase your visibility to those you want to influence - be seen regularly. Defense: recognize that familiarity shouldn\'t equal trust; evaluate substance separately from how often you\'ve encountered something.',

    back: 'Assigning people positive labels ("You\'re such a helpful person") tends to make them act consistently with those labels. This works through: 1) Activating self-perception - we believe what we\'re told about ourselves, 2) Commitment to identity - we want to be consistent with who we are, 3) Self-fulfilling prophecy - we act according to expectations. Studies show: children labeled as "neat and tidy" became neater; voters told they were "above-average citizens" voted more. Effective labeling: make it positive, specific, and plausible. Ethical consideration: use this to bring out genuine positive qualities, not to manipulate. Defense: evaluate whether labels fit your authentic self.',

Questions work because: 1) They cause self-reflection, 2) Most people answer favorably to positive identity questions, 3) Subsequent compliance maintains consistency. Research shows these questions increased positive responses by 15-20%. Ethical use: ask questions that genuinely help people clarify their values.

Low altitude: focuses on "how" - specific actions and implementation (e.g., "Eat 5 vegetables daily").

Match altitude to audience state: uncertain audiences need why; committed audiences need how. Defense: recognize when abstract appeals mask lack of practical substance.',

As a decision-maker: set criteria before reviewing options, accept "good enough," and limit comparison shopping. Strategic choice architecture: limit to 3-7 options with clear differentiation.',
