    front: '"Be water, my friend." What does Bruce Lee mean by this famous statement?',
    back: 'Water adapts to any container without losing its essence. Bruce Lee teaches us to be formless and adaptable in life - rigid structures break under pressure, but flexibility allows us to flow around obstacles. In practice, this means releasing fixed mindsets, adapting to circumstances, and responding appropriately to each unique situation rather than forcing predetermined solutions.',

    front: 'How does water demonstrate both gentleness and power according to Bruce Lee?',
    back: 'Water can flow gently around rocks or crash with devastating force. This duality teaches that true strength includes softness. A rigid tree breaks in a storm while a flexible reed survives. In life, knowing when to yield and when to assert force is wisdom. Gentleness is not weakness - it is controlled power with awareness.',

    front: '"Empty your cup so that it may be filled." What must we empty to learn?',
    back: 'We must empty ourselves of preconceptions, ego, and the illusion that we already know. A cup full of old tea cannot receive new tea. Many approach learning while clinging to past knowledge, defending their current understanding rather than genuinely receiving new wisdom. True learning requires humility and openness - becoming a beginner again regardless of past expertise.',

    front: 'Why did Bruce Lee reject classical martial arts styles and forms?',
    back: 'Classical styles create limitation through rigid patterns. They prioritize tradition over effectiveness and form over function. Bruce Lee saw that reality is fluid - no two fights are identical, no two opponents the same. Clinging to set patterns makes one predictable and unable to adapt. He advocated studying all styles but being bound by none, using what works in the moment.',

    front: '"Absorb what is useful, discard what is useless, add what is uniquely your own." How do you apply this?',
    back: 'First, approach all knowledge with openness, testing everything through direct experience. Second, honestly evaluate what works for YOU - not what tradition or authority claims should work. Third, have the courage to reject what does not serve you. Finally, synthesize and personalize - your expression must be authentic to your nature, not an imitation of others. This applies to fighting, art, business, and life itself.',

    back: 'A "classical mess" is someone so bound by tradition, forms, and external authority that they cannot respond authentically. They move in predetermined patterns, think in borrowed concepts, and express someone else\'s truth. They are mechanical rather than alive, reactive rather than creative. The classical mess has traded genuine understanding for the comfort of established systems.',

    front: '"Using no way as way, having no limitation as limitation." Explain this paradox.',
    back: 'This is the highest level of mastery. Having "no way" means not being confined to any single method or system. Having "no limitation" means your only boundary is having no artificial boundaries. You respond freely to each moment. This is not chaos or ignorance of technique - it comes AFTER mastering many ways and then transcending them. The formless emerges from form, not from the absence of training.',

    front: 'How does the "be water" philosophy apply to handling conflict in daily life?',
    back: 'In conflict, water does not push back against obstacles - it flows around them. When someone is aggressive, instead of meeting force with force (which creates destruction), you can redirect, absorb, or simply flow elsewhere. This might mean: not arguing with someone set in their position, finding alternative solutions when blocked, or adapting your approach based on who you are dealing with. Flexibility is not surrender - it is strategic intelligence.',

    front: 'What does Bruce Lee mean when he says "the medicine for my suffering I had within me from the beginning"?',
    back: 'All external seeking is ultimately futile because the solutions lie within. We search for teachers, systems, and answers outside ourselves, but true transformation comes from self-knowledge and inner development. The teacher can only point the way - the student must walk it. Your potential, your healing, your power - these already exist within you. The journey is about removing obstacles to what is already there, not acquiring something new.',

    front: 'Why did Bruce Lee describe styles as "a crystallization"?',
    back: 'Crystallization means something fluid becoming fixed and solid. A style begins as one person\'s living, flowing expression - their honest response to reality. But when codified and passed down, it becomes frozen, rigid, dead. Future practitioners follow the form without understanding the spirit that created it. They worship the finger pointing at the moon rather than looking at the moon itself. Living truth cannot be crystallized without killing it.',

    back: 'Jeet Kune Do means "The Way of the Intercepting Fist" - but more importantly, it is a philosophy of liberation, not a fixed system. Bruce Lee resisted it becoming codified because that would contradict its core principle: having no fixed patterns. JKD is about the process of self-discovery and honest expression, not a collection of techniques. The moment it becomes "the JKD way," it becomes another limiting cage.',

    front: '"Simplicity is the key to brilliance." How does this apply beyond martial arts?',
    back: 'Complexity often masks confusion and insecurity. True masters in any field arrive at elegant simplicity - but this simplicity comes AFTER understanding complexity, not from avoiding it. In communication, the clearest message wins. In design, unnecessary elements dilute impact. In strategy, simple plans are more executable. Sophistication is not about adding more; it is about removing everything that is not essential until only the essence remains.',

    front: 'What did Bruce Lee mean by "honest self-expression"?',
    back: 'Most people express a false self - filtered through what they think they should be, influenced by others\' expectations, performing roles rather than being authentic. Honest self-expression means fighting (and living) from your true nature without pretense. It requires deep self-knowledge, courage to be vulnerable, and rejection of imitation. Your movements, words, and actions should express who you genuinely are, not a copy of someone else.',

  {
    id: 'fc-bl-014',
    front: '"The great mistake is to anticipate the outcome of the engagement." Why is anticipation dangerous?',
    back: 'Anticipation pulls you out of the present moment into an imagined future. When you expect a specific attack or outcome, you become blind to what is actually happening. You prepare for the fight you imagined rather than the one unfolding. This creates openings for your opponent and makes you reactive rather than responsive. True presence means seeing reality as it is, fresh each moment, without the filter of expectation.',

  {
    id: 'fc-bl-015',
    front: 'How does economy of motion relate to Bruce Lee\'s philosophy of simplicity?',
    back: 'Every unnecessary movement wastes energy, creates openings, and telegraphs intention. Economy of motion means achieving maximum effect with minimum effort - the straight line rather than the curved, the direct attack rather than the elaborate. This extends to life: unnecessary complications drain resources, extra words weaken communication, cluttered thinking obscures clarity. Efficiency is elegance. Do only what is necessary, nothing more.',

    id: 'fc-bl-016',
    front: '"To know oneself is to study oneself in action with another person." Why is solitary study insufficient?',
    back: 'True nature reveals itself under pressure, in relationship, in conflict. Alone, we can maintain illusions about ourselves. But when interacting with others - especially in challenging situations - our real patterns emerge. Are you patient, or merely untested? Are you brave, or have you avoided fear? Self-knowledge requires the mirror of relationship and the test of action. Theory must be proven in practice.',

    id: 'fc-bl-017',
    front: 'What is the difference between "mechanical efficiency" and "alive efficiency" in JKD?',
    back: 'Mechanical efficiency is robotic precision - technically correct but dead, predictable, without spirit. Alive efficiency is spontaneous, creative, responsive - the technique emerges naturally from the moment. A machine can have mechanical efficiency; only a conscious being can have alive efficiency. Training ingrains mechanics until they become unconscious, freeing the mind to be fully present and creatively responsive. The goal is organic, not robotic.',

  {
    id: 'fc-bl-018',
    front: '"Art is the expression of the self." How did Bruce Lee see martial arts as an art form?',
    back: 'For Bruce Lee, fighting was a medium of self-expression, like painting or poetry. Each person\'s combat should reflect their unique nature - their body, spirit, understanding. Imitation is not art. Memorized patterns are not expression. True martial art emerges when the practitioner transcends technique and expresses their authentic self through movement. The fight becomes a canvas; the fighter becomes both artist and artwork.',

    id: 'fc-bl-019',
    front: 'What does "the tools are there to destroy" mean in Bruce Lee\'s philosophy?',
    back: 'The techniques and methods learned are scaffolding, not the building. You use tools to construct, then set them aside. Forms teach principles, but must be transcended. The goal is to internalize lessons so deeply that you no longer consciously apply them - they become part of you. Then you destroy the tools: forget the techniques as techniques, and simply act. Holding onto tools beyond their usefulness becomes a new limitation.',

  {
    id: 'fc-bl-020',
    front: 'How did Bruce Lee view the relationship between mind and body in combat?',
    back: 'Bruce Lee rejected mind-body separation. In true action, there is no thinker separate from the action - only total presence. Thinking creates delay; the body knows faster than the conscious mind can process. Training is for the body to absorb principles so the mind can be empty in action. The goal is "no-mind" (mushin): complete unity of intention, perception, and action. When you think, you are late.',

    front: '"Self-actualization is the important thing." What did this mean to Bruce Lee?',
    back: 'Self-actualization is becoming fully who you are meant to be - realizing your complete potential, not an imitation of someone else\'s potential. It means developing all aspects of yourself, expressing your unique nature, and living authentically. For Bruce Lee, martial arts was a vehicle for this larger purpose. Fighting was never just about fighting; it was about human development, self-discovery, and the full flowering of individual potential.',

  },
  {
    id: 'fc-bl-022',
    front: '"Real living is living for others." How does this connect to Bruce Lee\'s individualism?',
    back: 'This appears paradoxical but is not. True self-actualization naturally leads to contribution. When you fully develop yourself, you have more to give. Empty people cannot truly help others. Bruce Lee gave back through teaching, inspiring, and breaking barriers. The individualism he advocated was not selfishness but self-development that ultimately serves humanity. You must first become someone before you can meaningfully give.',

    front: '"Do not fear failure. Not failure, but low aim, is the crime." What does Bruce Lee teach about fear of failure?',
    back: 'Fear of failure is actually fear of judgment, rejection, or discomfort - it keeps us playing small. But the real failure is never attempting, never stretching, never risking. Aiming low guarantees mediocrity. Bruce Lee failed many times - rejected by Hollywood, doubted by traditionalists. But he aimed at the impossible. Each failure taught something; low aim teaches nothing. The crime is the unlived life, the untested potential, the dream never pursued.',

    id: 'fc-bl-024',
    front: 'How did Bruce Lee view fear as essential to martial arts training?',
    back: 'Fear is not the enemy - it is valuable information and fuel for growth. Controlled fear creates alertness, sharpens senses, and prepares the body for action. The goal is not eliminating fear but having a functional relationship with it. Fear only becomes destructive when it leads to paralysis or panic. A warrior uses fear without being controlled by it. Courage is not absence of fear but action despite it.',

    front: '"Knowing is not enough, we must apply. Willing is not enough, we must do." Why is action supreme?',
    back: 'Knowledge without application is intellectual entertainment. Understanding fear without facing it changes nothing. Reading about swimming does not teach swimming. There is a vast gap between knowing and doing that can only be bridged by actual action. Bruce Lee had no patience for theorists who never tested their theories. Transformation happens through lived experience, not accumulated information. Philosophy must walk, not just talk.',

    front: 'What is the "inner enemy" that Bruce Lee believed we must defeat?',
    back: 'The inner enemy is the collection of fears, limitations, self-doubts, and ego defenses that prevent authentic living. It is the voice that says you cannot, should not, are not good enough. External opponents are temporary; the inner enemy is constant. Most people never face a true external threat but battle the inner enemy daily. Until you conquer self-imposed limitations, external victories are hollow. The greatest battle is within.',

    front: '"The enemy of development is this pain phobia." How does avoiding pain limit growth?',
    back: 'Growth requires discomfort. Training hurts. Confronting fears is painful. Honest self-examination wounds the ego. When we structure life to avoid all pain, we structure it to avoid all growth. Comfort is the enemy of development. Bruce Lee trained through exhaustion, pushed beyond limits, embraced difficulty as the path to strength. The pain phobia keeps people weak, undeveloped, living inside ever-shrinking comfort zones.',

    back: 'False pride comes from external achievements, possessions, associations, titles - things that can be taken away. True self-worth comes from who you ARE: your character, integrity, self-knowledge, and authentic development. You are not your championship belt, your followers, or your wealth. These are external and temporary. True worth is internal and cannot be given or taken by others. Know yourself and external validation becomes unnecessary.',

    back: 'Self-actualization is not an event but a process - the daily accumulation of small efforts. Bruce Lee trained every single day, not just for physical development but as a practice of becoming. Each day of practice is a deposit in the account of your future self. Skipped days are withdrawals. There is no shortcut, no hack. The champion is made in training, revealed in competition. Daily discipline is the bridge between who you are and who you could become.',

But all external success is empty if you are not real. Bruce Lee could have made easier films, taught simpler systems, sought approval. Instead, he insisted on authentic expression at every turn. To be real means knowing yourself honestly, expressing yourself truthfully, and living in alignment with your actual nature. It is the foundation of a meaningful life.',
