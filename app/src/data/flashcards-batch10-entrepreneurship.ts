    back: 'Premature scaling is investing in growth before achieving product-market fit. Signs include: hiring sales before repeatable process, heavy marketing with poor retention, building features before validation, scaling operations before demand. Startup Genome Project found 74% of failed startups scaled prematurely. Focus: find PMF first, then scale. Premature scaling wastes money and creates false confidence.',
