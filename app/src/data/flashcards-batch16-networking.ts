    back: 'A preparation routine before important networking meetings: 1) Review their LinkedIn and recent work, 2) Prepare 3 thoughtful questions, 3) Identify what value you can offer, 4) Set a clear objective for the meeting, 5) Practice your introduction, 6) Arrive early to settle in. Preparation converts nervous energy into confident curiosity.',

    back: 'Negative information has disproportionate impact on impressions compared to positive information. One awkward moment can outweigh many positive interactions. Implications: be authentic but thoughtful, avoid controversial topics early, focus on listening (hard to mess up), and if you make a mistake, acknowledge it directly rather than hoping it goes unnoticed.',

Sponsors use their political capital to create opportunities, recommend you for roles, and vouch for you in rooms you\'re not in. To gain sponsors: demonstrate high performance, be visible to senior leaders, and explicitly communicate your goals. Mentorship is easier to get; sponsorship is more valuable.',

Use a system (Notion, Airtable, or actual CRM) to: 1) Track when you last contacted someone, 2) Note personal details and conversation topics, 3) Set reminders for follow-ups, 4) Categorize relationships by strength and strategic importance, 5) Log interactions.

Strategic networking can be authentic when: you genuinely want to help, you\'re honest about what you\'re seeking, and you\'re the same person in every context. Inauthenticity is exhausting and eventually detected.',
