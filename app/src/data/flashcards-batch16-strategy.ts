But research shows first-movers often fail; "fast followers" frequently win by learning from pioneers\' mistakes. Timing considerations: 1) Market readiness (too early = educating market at your cost), 2) Technology maturity, 3) Competitive response time, 4) Your capability readiness. Best timing: arrive just as market inflects.',

Types: resource constraints (budget, people), market constraints (competition, regulation), time constraints (windows of opportunity). Counter-intuitively, more constraints often lead to better strategies. Remove a constraint only if it\'s truly artificial, not because it\'s uncomfortable.',
