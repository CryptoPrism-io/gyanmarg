      overview: 'Learn the systematic decision-making framework that built Bridgewater, the world\'s largest hedge fund.',
      mainContent: `# Ray Dalio's Principles: Systematic Success

Ray Dalio built Bridgewater Associates into a $150 billion hedge fund using a radically transparent, principle-based approach.

## The Core Philosophy

### Radical Truth
- Seek truth above all else
- Face reality, however painful
- Don't let emotions cloud judgment
- Data > opinions

### Radical Transparency
- No one hides anything
- Record all meetings
- Share mistakes openly
- Learn from everything

## The Five-Step Process

Dalio's universal process for achieving anything:

### 1. Have Clear Goals
- Know what you really want
- Prioritize ruthlessly
- Don't confuse goals with desires

### 2. Identify Problems
- View problems as opportunities
- Don't tolerate problems
- Be precise about what's wrong

### 3. Diagnose Root Causes
- Distinguish symptoms from diseases
- Ask "why" five times
- Look at patterns, not incidents

### 4. Design Solutions
- Think creatively
- Consider second-order consequences
- Don't solve symptoms

### 5. Execute
- Follow through
- Establish clear metrics
- Hold yourself accountable

## Believability-Weighted Decision Making

Not all opinions are equal:
- Weight views by track record
- Seek out people who've done it
- Triangulate from multiple sources
- Your believability in an area = your right to an opinion

## The Machine Analogy

Dalio views organizations as machines:
- Design the machine to achieve outcomes
- Compare outcomes to goals
- Diagnose why machine isn't working
- Modify the machine

## Key Principles

1. **Pain + Reflection = Progress**
2. **Don't mistake desires for goals**
3. **The greatest failure is failure to ask for help**
4. **Recognize that tough love is the best kind**
5. **Worry about achieving goals, not looking good**`,
      keyTakeaway: 'Dalio\'s systematic approach combines radical truth-seeking with structured problem-solving, where decisions are weighted by believability and everything becomes a learning opportunity.',
      actionItem: 'Write down your top 3 goals. For each, identify the biggest obstacle. Diagnose the root cause (not symptom) of each obstacle.',
      quiz: {
        question: 'What does "believability-weighted decision making" mean in Dalio\'s framework?',
        options: ['Trusting only yourself', 'Weighting opinions by track record and expertise', 'Following the majority view', 'Ignoring expert opinions'],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation: 'Believability-weighted decisions give more weight to opinions from people with proven track records in the specific area being discussed.'

      mainContent: `# Buffett's Wisdom: Timeless Investing

Warren Buffett grew $105,000 into $130+ billion through disciplined value investing over 70+ years.

## Core Investment Principles

### 1. Circle of Competence
- Only invest in what you understand
- Knowing the edge of your circle is crucial
- Better to expand slowly than stumble outside

### 2. Margin of Safety
- Buy at significant discount to intrinsic value
- Leaves room for error
- "Price is what you pay, value is what you get"

### 3. Long-Term Orientation
- "Our favorite holding period is forever"
- Compound gains without tax drag
- Let great businesses grow

### 4. Quality Over Price
- Great business at fair price > Fair business at great price
- Moats matter (sustainable competitive advantages)
- Management integrity is non-negotiable

## The Economic Moat

Buffett looks for durable competitive advantages:

**Types of Moats:**
- Brand power (Coca-Cola)
- Network effects (Visa, Mastercard)
- Switching costs (Microsoft)
- Cost advantages (Walmart)
- Regulatory barriers

**Moat Test:**
"If you gave me $10 billion and said 'Take away their market share,' could I?"

## Business Evaluation

### What Buffett Wants
1. Understandable business
2. Favorable long-term economics
3. Able and trustworthy management
4. Sensible price tag

### Red Flags
- Excessive debt
- Management compensation misaligned
- Frequent strategy changes
- Complicated financials

## Famous Buffett Quotes

- "Be fearful when others are greedy, greedy when others are fearful"
- "Rule #1: Never lose money. Rule #2: Never forget rule #1"
- "It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price"
- "The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient"`,
      keyTakeaway: 'Buffett\'s success comes from staying within his circle of competence, demanding a margin of safety, investing for the long-term, and prioritizing quality businesses with durable moats.',
      actionItem: 'Define your circle of competence. What industries or businesses do you truly understand? Be honest about the edges.',

      overview: 'Learn the multidisciplinary thinking approach that made Charlie Munger a legendary investor.',
      mainContent: `# Charlie Munger's Worldly Wisdom

Charlie Munger advocates for a "latticework of mental models" - frameworks from multiple disciplines that improve decision-making.

## The Mental Models Approach

### Why Multiple Models?
"To a man with a hammer, everything looks like a nail."

Using only one mental model (like pure economics) limits your understanding. Reality is complex and multidisciplinary.

### The Latticework
Collect models from:
- Psychology
- Mathematics
- Physics
- Biology
- Economics
- History
- Engineering

## Key Mental Models

### 1. Inversion (Mathematics)
Instead of "How do I succeed?"
Ask "How do I fail?" Then avoid those things.

"Tell me where I'm going to die, so I don't go there."

### 2. Second-Order Thinking
First-order: What happens immediately?
Second-order: Then what happens?

Most people stop at first-order.

### 3. The Lollapalooza Effect
When multiple psychological tendencies combine, effects multiply massively.

Example: A sale (scarcity) + social proof + authority = buying frenzy

### 4. Opportunity Cost
Every choice foregoes alternatives.
"The best investment is always the opportunity you declined."

### 5. Margin of Safety
From engineering: Build bridges to handle 3x expected load.
From investing: Buy at significant discount to intrinsic value.

### 6. Mr. Market (from Graham)
The market is a manic-depressive who offers to buy or sell daily.
Use his mood swings; don't let them use you.

## Munger on Psychology

25 psychological tendencies that cause misjudgment:
1. Incentive-caused bias
2. Liking/loving tendency
3. Disliking/hating tendency
4. Doubt-avoidance tendency
5. Inconsistency-avoidance tendency
6. Reciprocation tendency
7. Social proof tendency
8. Contrast-misreaction tendency
9. Authority-misinfluence tendency
10. And 15+ more...

## Munger's Advice

- "Spend each day trying to be a little wiser than when you woke up"
- "The big money is not in the buying and selling, but in the waiting"
- "Mimicking the herd invites regression to the mean"
- "It is remarkable how much long-term advantage people like us have gotten by trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent"`,
      keyTakeaway: 'Munger\'s approach uses multiple mental models from diverse disciplines to avoid single-framework blindness, combined with inversion thinking and deep understanding of human psychology.',
      actionItem: 'Pick one of Munger\'s mental models (inversion, second-order thinking, or opportunity cost). Apply it to a current decision you\'re facing.',
      quiz: {
        question: 'What is "inversion" as a mental model?',

        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation: 'Inversion means approaching problems backwards - instead of asking "how do I succeed?", ask "how would I fail?" and then avoid those failure modes.'

      overview: 'Learn how Peter Lynch achieved 29.2% annual returns at Magellan Fund through his "invest in what you know" approach.',
      mainContent: `# Peter Lynch: The Amateur's Advantage

Peter Lynch ran Fidelity's Magellan Fund from 1977-1990, achieving 29.2% annual returns and growing assets from $18 million to $14 billion.

## Invest In What You Know

### The Local Advantage
Everyday consumers discover great investments:
- Notice what stores are crowded
- See what products people love
- Observe industry trends firsthand

Lynch found many of his best ideas at shopping malls, talking to family, and observing everyday life.

### Professional vs. Amateur
- Professionals: Limited by mandates, benchmark tracking
- Amateurs: Freedom to invest anywhere, no quarterly pressure
- Your advantage: You see things Wall Street misses

## Six Stock Categories

Lynch categorized companies to set appropriate expectations:

### 1. Slow Growers (2-4% growth)
Large, mature companies paying dividends.
Example: Utilities

### 2. Stalwarts (10-12% growth)
Solid companies, steady performers.
Example: Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble

### 3. Fast Growers (20-25% growth)
Small, aggressive companies in growing industries.
Highest potential returns but higher risk.

### 4. Cyclicals
Companies whose profits fluctuate with economic cycles.
Example: Automakers, airlines

### 5. Turnarounds
Beaten-down companies with recovery potential.
High risk, high reward if successful.

### 6. Asset Plays
Companies with hidden assets the market doesn't recognize.
Example: Real estate holdings not reflected in stock price.

## Lynch's Key Metrics

### PEG Ratio
P/E Ratio ÷ Growth Rate

- PEG < 1 = Potentially undervalued
- PEG = 1 = Fairly valued
- PEG > 1 = Potentially overvalued

### The Two-Minute Drill
Can you explain in 2 minutes:
1. Why you own this stock
2. What must happen for it to succeed
3. What could go wrong

If not, you don't understand it well enough.

## Lynch's Wisdom

- "Know what you own, and know why you own it"
- "The best stock to buy may be the one you already own"
- "Never invest in any idea you can't illustrate with a crayon"
- "In the stock market, the most important organ is the stomach, not the brain"`,
      keyTakeaway: 'Lynch\'s approach leverages everyday observation and the amateur\'s advantage, using the PEG ratio and deep understanding of what you own to find great investments.',
      actionItem: 'Look around you today. What products, stores, or services seem to be thriving? Research one of the companies behind them.',
      quiz: {
        question: 'What does a PEG ratio below 1 potentially indicate?',
        options: ['The company is overvalued', 'The company is potentially undervalued relative to its growth', 'The company has no growth', 'The company will go bankrupt'],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation: 'PEG (P/E divided by Growth Rate) below 1 suggests the stock may be undervalued relative to its growth rate - paying less than 1x the growth rate.'

      overview: 'Learn to navigate market cycles using insights from legendary investor Howard Marks.',
      mainContent: `# Howard Marks: Mastering Market Cycles

Howard Marks, co-founder of Oaktree Capital, is renowned for his insights on market cycles and investor psychology.

## The Nature of Cycles

### Everything Is Cyclical
Nothing goes in one direction forever:
- Economics cycles
- Credit cycles
- Market cycles
- Psychology cycles

"Trees don't grow to the sky, and few things go to zero."

### The Pendulum Analogy
Markets swing like a pendulum:
- Between euphoria and depression
- Between overvaluation and undervaluation
- Between fear and greed

Rarely at equilibrium - always swinging toward extremes.

## The Two Key Questions

At any point, ask:
1. **Where are we in the cycle?**
2. **What does that imply for action?**

### Signs of Excess
- "It's different this time"
- New paradigm thinking
- Easy money and loose lending
- Speculative behavior
- "Everyone" making money

### Signs of Opportunity
- Widespread pessimism
- Capitulation
- "Stocks are dead"
- Quality assets at distressed prices

## Second-Level Thinking

### First-Level Thinking
"It's a good company, let's buy the stock."

### Second-Level Thinking
"It's a good company, but everyone thinks so, the stock is overpriced, let's sell."

Superior returns require thinking different AND better than consensus.

## Risk

### Marks on Risk
Risk is not volatility. Risk is the probability of permanent capital loss.

### The Risk-Return Relationship
- High-risk investments have wider possible outcomes
- Wide outcomes mean potential for both high returns AND losses
- Risk tolerance should match investment horizon

### Controlling Risk
"You can't predict. You can prepare."
- Diversification
- Margin of safety
- Emotional discipline
- Long-term orientation

## Key Quotes

- "The most dangerous thing is to buy something at the peak of its popularity"
- "The biggest investing errors come not from factors that are informational or analytical, but from those that are psychological"
- "Skepticism calls for pessimism when optimism is excessive"
- "The race to bottom-tick is one that will never be won"`,
      keyTakeaway: 'Marks teaches that understanding cycles and practicing second-level thinking helps investors recognize when to be aggressive and when to be defensive, avoiding the crowd\'s mistakes.',
      actionItem: 'Assess: Where do you think we are in the current market cycle? What evidence supports your view? What does that imply for your actions?',
      quiz: {
        question: 'According to Howard Marks, what is the definition of risk?',
        options: ['Volatility', 'Probability of permanent capital loss', 'Daily price movements', 'Leverage ratio'],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation: 'Marks defines risk as the probability of permanent capital loss, not volatility. A stock can be volatile but not risky if fundamental value is secure.'

      overview: 'Learn Ray Dalio\'s risk-parity approach to building portfolios that perform in any economic environment.',
      mainContent: `# The All-Weather Portfolio

Ray Dalio designed the All-Weather strategy to perform reasonably well regardless of economic conditions.

## The Four Seasons Framework

### Economic Environments
The economy moves through four states:
1. **Rising Growth** (economy expanding)
2. **Falling Growth** (economy contracting)
3. **Rising Inflation** (prices increasing)
4. **Falling Inflation** (prices stable/declining)

### Asset Performance by Season

**Rising Growth**: Stocks, corporate bonds, commodities thrive
**Falling Growth**: Treasury bonds, TIPS protect
**Rising Inflation**: TIPS, commodities, gold protect
**Falling Inflation**: Stocks, Treasury bonds thrive

## The All-Weather Allocation

Dalio's public recommendation:
- **30% Stocks** (US total market)
- **40% Long-Term Treasury Bonds** (20-25 year)
- **15% Intermediate Treasury Bonds** (7-10 year)
- **7.5% Gold**
- **7.5% Commodities**

### Why This Allocation?
- Heavier bond allocation balances stock volatility
- Gold and commodities hedge inflation
- Works in most environments
- Lower drawdowns than 60/40

## Risk Parity Concept

### Traditional Allocation Problem
60% stocks / 40% bonds seems balanced by dollars.
But stocks are ~3x more volatile than bonds.
So risk is actually 90% stocks / 10% bonds.

### Risk Parity Solution
Balance by risk contribution, not dollar allocation.
Each asset class contributes equally to portfolio risk.
Result: More stable returns across environments.

## Historical Performance

All-Weather vs. Traditional 60/40:
- Lower maximum drawdowns
- More consistent returns
- Better risk-adjusted performance
- Gives up some upside in strong bull markets

## Implementation

### Simple Version
Use low-cost index funds/ETFs:
- VTI (Total Stock Market)
- TLT (Long-Term Treasury)
- IEF (Intermediate Treasury)
- GLD (Gold)
- DJP or PDBC (Commodities)

### Rebalancing
- Annual rebalancing typically sufficient
- Some use threshold rebalancing (when allocations drift 5%+)

## Considerations

### Pros
- Reduces sequence-of-returns risk
- Smoother ride
- Works in various environments
- Good for those near/in retirement

### Cons
- May underperform in prolonged bull markets
- Bond-heavy during low-rate environments
- Requires discipline when stocks surge`,
      keyTakeaway: 'The All-Weather portfolio balances risk across economic environments using risk parity, providing more consistent returns with lower drawdowns than traditional allocations.',
      actionItem: 'Compare your current portfolio allocation to the All-Weather model. Calculate what percentage of your risk comes from stocks vs. other assets.',
      quiz: {
        question: 'Why does the All-Weather portfolio have a 55% bond allocation?',
        options: ['Bonds always outperform stocks', 'To balance risk contribution (stocks are 3x more volatile)', 'It\'s a mistake', 'Bonds pay higher dividends'],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation: 'Stocks are roughly 3x more volatile than bonds, so by dollar weighting, a 60/40 portfolio is actually 90/10 by risk. The All-Weather uses higher bond allocation to balance risk contributions.'

      mainContent: `# Naval on Wealth: Principles for the Internet Age

Naval Ravikant, AngelList founder and philosopher, shares a framework for wealth in the modern era.

## Seek Wealth, Not Money

### Definitions
- **Money**: How we transfer wealth
- **Status**: Your rank in social hierarchy
- **Wealth**: Assets that earn while you sleep

"You're not going to get rich renting out your time."

## The Three Types of Leverage

### 1. Labor (Oldest)
Other people working for you.
- Difficult to manage
- Requires leadership
- Linear scaling

### 2. Capital (Older)
Money working for you.
- Requires permission (investors)
- Scales well
- Traditional wealth path

### 3. Products with No Marginal Cost (Newest)
Code and media.
- No permission needed
- Infinite scaling
- Sleep while earning
- Books, podcasts, software, content

"An army of robots is freely available - it's called software."

## Specific Knowledge

### What Is It?
Knowledge that cannot be trained:
- Often developed through genuine curiosity
- Usually at the edge of your unique experiences
- Feels like play to you, looks like work to others

### Examples
- Understanding a niche market deeply
- Unique combination of skills
- Tacit knowledge from experience
- Creative ability in your domain

### How to Find It
"If you're not 100% in it, the person who is will outperform you."
Follow your genuine curiosity, not what's popular.

## Judgment

Naval emphasizes judgment as the highest form of leverage:
- Good judgment comes from experience
- Experience comes from bad judgment
- Eventually, judgment is worth billions

## Accountability

Take business risks under your own name:
- Society rewards those who take risk
- "Earn with your mind, not your time"
- Build reputation to get opportunities

## Key Naval Principles

1. "Arm yourself with specific knowledge, accountability, and leverage"
2. "Play long-term games with long-term people"
3. "All the returns in life come from compound interest"
4. "Learn to sell, learn to build. If you can do both, you will be unstoppable"
5. "Read what you love until you love to read"`,
      keyTakeaway: 'Naval\'s wealth framework focuses on building with leverage (code/media), developing specific knowledge you can\'t be trained in, and taking accountability for outcomes.',

        correctAnswer: 2,
        explanation: 'Code and media can be replicated infinitely at zero marginal cost, require no permission to create, and can earn while you sleep - making them the most powerful modern leverage.'

      mainContent: `# Antifragility: Profiting from Disorder

Nassim Nicholas Taleb introduces a concept beyond resilience: becoming stronger from stress.

## The Triad

### 1. Fragile
Harmed by volatility and disorder.
Like a wine glass - breaks under stress.
Examples: Over-leveraged portfolios, single income sources

### 2. Robust
Indifferent to volatility.
Like a rock - unchanged by stress.
Examples: Treasury bonds, gold

### 3. Antifragile
Improved by volatility.
Like a muscle - grows stronger from stress.
Examples: Evolution, some career paths, certain portfolios

## The Barbell Strategy

### Concept
Combine extremely safe with extremely risky.
Nothing in the middle.

### Portfolio Application
- 85-90% in ultra-safe assets (T-bills, cash)
- 10-15% in highly speculative investments

### Why It Works
- Maximum protection from ruin (safe portion)
- Unlimited upside (risky portion)
- Avoid the "sucker" middle ground
- Can't lose more than the risky portion

## Black Swans

### Definition
Rare, unpredictable events with massive impact.
Examples: 2008 crisis, COVID, technological breakthroughs

### Positive vs. Negative Black Swans
Position yourself to benefit from positive black swans while protecting against negative ones.

### Exposure Strategy
- Avoid negative black swan exposure
- Maximize positive black swan exposure
- "Option-like" payoffs: limited downside, unlimited upside

## Key Principles

### Via Negativa
Improvement through removal, not addition:
- Remove harmful things from your life
- Avoid stupid mistakes
- "Winning by not losing"

### Skin in the Game
Only trust those with something to lose:
- Advisors should eat their own cooking
- Risk-takers, not risk-givers
- Symmetry of upside and downside

### Lindy Effect
For non-perishable things, life expectancy increases with age:
- A book that's been in print 50 years will likely stay 50 more
- Apply to investment strategies, businesses, ideas

## Portfolio Application

### Antifragile Portfolio
- Core: Super-safe assets (can't be hurt)
- Satellite: High-optionality bets (asymmetric upside)
- Avoid: Middle-risk, leverage, complexity

### Career Application
- Build optionality (multiple income sources)
- Seek asymmetric opportunities
- Avoid path-dependent careers`,

      overview: 'Understand George Soros\'s theory of market reflexivity and how perceptions shape reality.',
      mainContent: `# Soros and Reflexivity: When Thinking Affects Reality

George Soros, who famously "broke the Bank of England," operates on a unique understanding of how markets actually work.

## The Theory of Reflexivity

### Classical Economics Assumption
Markets tend toward equilibrium.
Price reflects fundamental value.
Participants are rational observers.

### Soros's Challenge
In markets, participants aren't observers - they're participants.
Their perceptions and actions CHANGE the fundamentals.
This creates feedback loops.

### The Reflexive Loop
\`\`\`
Perception → Action → Reality Change → New Perception → New Action
\`\`\`

## Boom-Bust Cycles

### How Reflexivity Creates Bubbles

**The Setup**:
1. Positive trend emerges
2. Trend reinforces biased perception
3. Biased perception drives more action
4. Actions further reinforce trend
5. Fundamentals actually change to match perception
6. Eventually divergence becomes unsustainable
7. Crash

### Example: Real Estate Bubble
1. Housing prices rise
2. Banks perceive housing as "safe"
3. Banks lend more → prices rise more
4. Rising prices seem to confirm "housing is safe"
5. Lending standards loosen
6. Prices rise further
7. Eventually: collapse

## Trading Implications

### Soros's Approach
- Look for reflexive processes forming
- Identify self-reinforcing trends
- Recognize when fundamentals are being changed by perceptions
- Position for the eventual reversal

### Key Questions
1. What is the prevailing bias?
2. How is the bias affecting fundamentals?
3. Is this process strengthening or weakening?
4. What would cause reversal?

## Fallibility

### Soros on Human Knowledge
- We can never fully understand reality
- Our understanding is always imperfect
- This fallibility is especially pronounced in markets
- Yet we must act despite imperfect knowledge

### Implication for Investing
- Be prepared to be wrong
- Size positions assuming you could be wrong
- Adjust quickly when evidence contradicts thesis

## Famous Trades

### Breaking the British Pound (1992)
- Britain committed to ERM exchange rate
- Soros saw this as unsustainable
- Bet $10 billion against the pound
- Britain forced to devalue
- Soros made $1 billion in one day

### The Approach
Not predicting what will happen.
Identifying what CANNOT continue indefinitely.`,
