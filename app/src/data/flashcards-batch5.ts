In relationships: "I have given them 5 years, I cannot leave now." Manipulation: Toxic partners remind you of your investment to keep you trapped. Defense: 1. Past investment is gone regardless of future choices. 2. Ask: "If I were starting fresh today, would I choose this?" 3. Future potential matters more than past investment.',
