    back: 'Things that are not truly good or bad (only virtue is good) but are naturally preferable or to be avoided. Health, wealth, and reputation are "preferred" but not necessary for happiness. Their loss doesn\'t damage your character. We can pursue them while remaining detached from outcomes, focusing on what we control: our effort and integrity.',

    back: 'Deliberately experiencing minor hardships: cold showers, fasting, sleeping on the floor, wearing simple clothes. This builds resilience, reduces fear of loss, increases gratitude for comforts, and proves you can handle adversity. Seneca: "Set aside certain days on which you will practice poverty."

True Stoics experience joy, love, and connection; they\'ve just learned to manage destructive emotions through rational understanding.',
