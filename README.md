## Overview

**Gyanmarg** (Sanskrit: ज्ञानमार्ग - "Path of Knowledge") is a gamified learning platform that transforms 45+ curated ebooks into interactive, engaging learning experiences. Using evidence-based learning science techniques like spaced repetition, active recall, and interleaving, Gyanmarg helps you truly retain what you learn.

> *"विद्या ददाति विनयम्"* — "Knowledge gives humility" (Sanskrit Proverb)

### Why Gyanmarg?

- **The Problem**: Most people forget 90% of what they read within a week
- **The Solution**: Gamified microlearning with scientifically-proven retention techniques
- **The Result**: Knowledge that sticks, skills that compound

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/CryptoPrism-io/gyanmarg.git
cd gyanmarg/app

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

---

## Deployment

### Automatic (CI/CD)

Push to `master` triggers `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, which builds `app/` and
deploys to Firebase Hosting site `ai-polymind`. Authentication is keyless
(Workload Identity Federation) — there is no service-account key to rotate.

The workflow is path-filtered: it only runs for changes under `app/**`,
`firebase.json`, `firestore.rules`, or the workflow itself.

### Manual

```bash
cd app
npm run build
cd ..
npx firebase-tools deploy --only hosting:ai-polymind --project social-data-pipeline-and-push
```

## The Sanskrit Connection

In Hindu philosophy, there are four paths (margas) to self-realization:

1. **ज्ञानमार्ग (Gyanmarg)** - Path of Knowledge ← *This app*
2. **भक्तिमार्ग (Bhaktimarg)** - Path of Devotion
3. **कर्ममार्ग (Karmamarg)** - Path of Action
4. **राजमार्ग (Rajamarg)** - Path of Meditation
